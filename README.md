# Wilson Disease - Data Mining Project

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for a project focused on **predictive biomarker discovery** for **Wilson's Disease** using multi-omics datasets. The project is conducted under the course **CSC 503: Data Mining** at the University of Victoria.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on multi-omics datasets (transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.)
- Apply data preprocessing and normalization strategies
- Select relevant biomarkers using feature selection methods
- Build classification models to distinguish Wilson Disease cases vs. controls
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and relevant metrics

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **matplotlib & seaborn** for visualization
- **Conda** environment for reproducibility

## 📂 Directory Overview

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each major analysis phase
- `scripts/`: Reusable Python scripts for processing and modeling
- `results/`: Model outputs, figures, and evaluation metrics
- `reports/`: Progress reports and final report drafts
- `references/`: Supporting literature and dataset documentation

## 🔍 Datasets

Potential sources include:
- NCBI GEO: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
- OMIM Wilson Disease: [https://omim.org/entry/277900](https://omim.org/entry/277900)
- DisGeNET, Orphanet, and other rare disease databases

## 🧠 Background

Wilson's Disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in tissues. Identifying biomarkers using omics data can help in early diagnosis and understanding disease progression.
